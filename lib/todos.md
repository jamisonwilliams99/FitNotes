FEATURES THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

need to modify dbhelper so that it can save data from previously performed workouts
- weight used
- sets/reps actually done
- date user did workout
- PR for every exercise



- fix how exercise executions are navigated: the back button should always go to the previous workout
- - it works now, animations are just a little off but can worry about that later

- might want to add another attribute to class ExecutedSet: setNumber
- optimize input validation in ExerciseExecution
- add input validation to entire app
- add screen to view previously performed workouts
- add ability to do supersets
